       <p>Web copywriting is the ability,or rather the art,of writing content that is persuasive towards the audience and that leads to a conversion.
         In the past, the copywriter was a figure present in every journalistic editorial office, who was in charge of writing announcements and advertisements. Over time this professional has become more and more specialized.
       Today copy is a key element of digital marketing and carries out activities related to the numerous aspects of online content, such as attracting a potential customer or persuading him through an engaging text that ends with a call to action.
     The product of copywriters on websites today all start from an in-depth study of the brand and its target audience. To write effective copy it is essential to know the language fully and have a large vocabulary, as well as various marketing techniques. It is important to write your own copy with creativity and try not to bore the reader, a text that has already been read will hardly involve him. Through a persuasive language and a radical knowledge of the product and the target, the copywriter is the one who indirectly calls the customers to action.</p>
