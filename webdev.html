       <p>By web development I mean the creation and development of a website. Through the two HTML and CSS programming languages it is possible to build a website completely from scratch, adding contents with the first and positioning and stylizing them with the second. After having done a phase of discovering your target and having drafted a copy, the time comes to build a body to which our text must be inserted. Making a good website is very laborious, which is why usually in large companies a dedicated team works on it, but modifying small parts or creating small websites is a service of my competence and an example is this site, my personal portfolio website, created by me totally from the beginning and written only in HTML and CSS language.
       Although the framework of the site can be created with the two languages HTML and CSS, in order to be able to send it into operation with all the back-end processes, another language is required, JavaScript, which with script functions starts events triggered by the user with the mouse.</p>
